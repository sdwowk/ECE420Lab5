Task 2 steps:

	val text = sc.textFile("data_input")
	val inNeighbours = text.map(line => (line.split("\t")(0), line.split("\t")(1)))
	val outNeighbours = text.map(line => (line.split("\t")(1), line.split("\t")(0)))
	val inNodes = inNeighbours.groupByKey()
	val outNodes = outNeighbours.groupByKey()
	val result = inNodes.join(outNodes)

	// result now holds all the nodes as keys and list of their neighbours as values
